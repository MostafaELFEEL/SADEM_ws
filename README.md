# Graduation Project: Swarm Of Autonomous Drones for Environment Mapping
## Overview:
The aim of this project was to develop a swarm of autonomous drones that can generate detailed 3D visualizations of any indoor or outdoor area. The system was designed to consist of several drones equipped with stereo cameras and an on-ground base station that performs the heavy computation needed to generate the visualizations. The drones were supposed to navigate and localize themselves using a combination of inertial navigation and visual odometry, while communication and coordination between the drones were to be enabled through the use of wireless protocols and algorithms. We have made significant advancements in our autonomous drone system, including improved drone control and response. By integrating SLAM techniques, specifically ORB-SLAM3, we have successfully achieved accurate drone localization and precise control over its position and orientation (x/y/z/roll/pitch/yaw). Furthermore, we have enhanced the manual flight mode for improved user experience and control. Most notably, we have successfully flown the drone autonomously using ORBSLAM 3 and Mission Planner to navigate through predefined waypoints. These achievements demonstrate the potential of our system in enabling autonomous flight and 3D visualization capabilities.
